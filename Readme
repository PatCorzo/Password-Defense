# 🔐 Password Strength Tester

## 📘 Project Overview

In today's digital environment, weak passwords pose a serious threat to personal and organizational security. The **Password Strength Tester** is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of user-generated passwords and offer actionable feedback. By analyzing factors such as length, complexity, common patterns, and dictionary-based weaknesses, this tool encourages safer password practices through clear, constructive guidance.

Optional support for external breach-detection APIs (e.g., HaveIBeenPwned) allows users to verify if a password has been compromised in known data leaks.
